--Intro to Tensors
    --Plane Vectors
        --Vectors as a whole are special matricies {Which are just a compact notation of equations}
            --They act as matrices because since vectors have a directional component, they are often written as ordered pairs. This means the ordered pair form can be considered a list of numbers, which then forms the matrix
            --Often seen as column matrices {Just one column and a set number of rows}
            --Not to be confused with scalars which are just magnitudes, NO DIRECTIONS
        --Machine learning vectors may seem weird; absolute length but relative direction measured against reference
            --Usually in radians/degrees with positive counterclockwise
        --Plane vectors are the most straightforward tensors, similar to the regular vectors we know. Just a vector written in a plane where each row corresponds to a directional component.
            --The dimensional level tells you the amount of components/rows total 
    --Tensors
        --Mathematical representation of entities that can be characterized by magnitude and multiple directions 
            --Includes plane vectors, covectors, and linear operators
        --Represented by an array of 3R numbers {in 3D space} where R represents the rank of the tensor
            --Scalars are still tensors, they just have rank 0 because no direction
       --To separate, scalars = number, vectors = ordered set, tensors = array
--Basics of TensorFlow
    --At this point will largely
